## Assignment

Full details [available here &rArr;]([./Initial.md](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)).

Key points from the text:

- Create a grid of 'pixel' divs using JavaScript; not by hand
- 'pixel' divs should change color on mouse hover
- User should be able to set 'resolution' up to 100 'pixels' per side
- Total area for 'pixel' divs should remain constant (960px by 960px is suggested)

### Extra Credit

> 1. Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB values with each interaction.
> 2. Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely coloured) square in only ten interactions.
